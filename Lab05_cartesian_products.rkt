;; This lab will build off of the previous lab.
;; At the bottom of this file, you'll find many helper functions,
;;   all from the previous lab, to help you complete this one.

;; Again, like in last lab, we'll use lists to represent sets,
;;   but we won't let there be duplicate elements
;;   and we won't care about the element order.
;; If a function you write outputs a list
;;   and your output doesn't have the same order as the examples, that's okay.
;;
;; Our goal here is to build up from ground up a framework of funcions which
;; allow to generate Cartesian products and lists of all k-element subsets of
;; a given set.
;;
;; We'll start with small functions.

;; distinct-elems? checks whether a tuple's elements are distinct
;; You can use the make-set function to check whether after applying
;; it to a tuple the length of the tuple does not change. When the tuple
;; has less than 2 elements return #t
;;
;; (distinct-elems? '(1 1 3 5)) -> #f
;; (distinct-elems? '(2 7 12)) -> #t
;; (distinct-elems? '(1)) -> #t
;; (distinct-elems? '()) -> #t

(define (distinct-elems? tuple)
    (if(= (length tuple) (length (make-set tuple)))

;; Write a "robust" version of the cons function. Namely, when the "object" argument
;; below is a list, then the function returns that list with the pre-pended x (hence
;; in this case rcons is indistinguishable from cons. 
;; If the "object" argument is not a list then rcons should return the list (x object)

;; For simplicity, assume below that k is a positive integer >= 2,  and that the list lst contains only distinct numbers.

;; (subsets 4 '(1 2 3 4)) -> '((1 2 3 4))
;;
;; You can use the below hints or implement the function in your own way.

(define (subsets k lst)
  ; 1) Generate the list consisting of k copies of the given list
  (define list-of-lists (repeat k lst))
  
  ; 2) Generate the cartesian product of the lists
  (define cart-prod  (cartesian-product list-of-lists))

  ; 3) Discard the tuples in which there is a pair of repeated elements.
  ; What will be left after this step are the tuples consisting of distinct elements
  ; but they will appear in all possible orders (permutations)
  ; You can use the filter function (hence you must use #lang racket in the top line of
  ; this file)
  (define subsets-with-permutations  (filter distinct-elems? cart-prod))

  
  ; 4) Let's define a quick nested function which sorts tuples
  ; in the ascending order
  (define (order tuple) (sort tuple <))

  ; 5) sort each tuple so that, for example, (1 2 3) and (3 1 2) become
  ; (1 2 3) and (1 2 3). Doing that will make all tuples representing a single
  ; set the same. You can use the map function h
  (define repeated-tuples  (map order subsets-with-permutations))

  ; 6) Now eliminate all repeated tuples by using the make-set functionj
  (make-set repeated-tuples)
)
